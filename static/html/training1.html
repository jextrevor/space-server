<h1>Commander Training</h1>
<p>Welcome Commander. As presiding officer it is your job to give orders to your fellow crew members.</p>
<p>You will need to learn the basics of each station so you will know who to give orders to. When giving orders make sure they are clear and concise. After learning your own station, go and learn your crews' stations.</p>
<p>You have 3 main station sections: Alerts, Communications, and Objectives.</p>
<p>In the Alerts section, you can set the alert status.<br />
Statuses can be used to increase the intensity of a mission or to notify crew members of a situation.</p>
<p>Tip: The mission is saved when the alert status is switched to green so that it can be resumed after a failure.</p>
<p>In the Communications section, you can send and receive messages and set the sending frequency.<br />
Use messaging to call for help, to give orders to allied ships, or to communicate with enemies.</p>
<p>Tip: Enter in a ship address (obtainable from your Operations officer) to send to a specific ship.</p>
<p>Tip: Use the frequencies to limit who can see the messages you send.</p>
<p>Tip: In order for allies to understand your orders you must make them very clear.<br />
For example: "Go to coords 12,56,123. Get torpedoes. Patrol area at coords 565,75632,54."</p>
<p>In the Objectives section you can review current objectives and how many are completed.<br />
Use this to track mission progress and to inform your crew what needs to be done.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h6>Good luck on your mission!</h6>
