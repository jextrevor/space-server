intense.mp3 Very Intense, with Orchestra. I would recommend "On the verge of Winning" , or epic battle/exposition

battle.mp3 Could be a good limit song, or "behind enemy lines". Hmm...

chance.mp3 Another good limit song, or chance song. Or for diffusing a bomb/hacking into enemy systems. CELLOS!

intense2.mp3 Good limit song or exposition. Gets better a little into the song. Hmm...

intense3.mp3 Great limit song. Goes in same category as chance.mp3

intense4.mp3 This one is more of a "intense get ready for the battle"

intense5.mp3 Hmm... more of a background song. It's kind of intense, more of a "get ready one", or a far off battle.

limit.mp3 great limit one. keep as is.

travel.mp3 good as is. it could be either good exposition or just a "in the middle". also a good intense one.

training.mp3 Very ambient. Maybe a good exposition or just training.

training2.mp3 Another good training song.

awe.mp3 Great for seeing cool wonders of space or just slow travel. Hmm...

exposition.mp3 Great drums. Maybe exposition? Hmm...

NEED A VICTORY AND A DEFEAT SONG and a BATTLE SONG.

Hmm... means not sure about using it.
